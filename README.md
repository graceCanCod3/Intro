# About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m **Grace Madikaegbu**, a passionate **software engineer** and former **school health tech**, with a keen interest in **healthcare, technology,** and a mission to improve the lives of others through innovative software solutions. Iâ€™m currently transitioning from the healthcare field to **software development**, building on my experience from the **General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program**, where I honed my skills in:

- Python & Django
- JavaScript & React
- SQL
- HTML/CSS

## My Focus

My projects often focus on merging my two passions: **community** and **technology**. I'm particularly excited about how **data analytics** and **software development** can be used to create more efficient healthcare systems, provide better patient care, and empower communities.

## Let's Collaborate!

Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate on **open-source projects** or healthcare/community related tech initiatives. Feel free to check out my repositories or connect with me for any collaborative opportunities!
